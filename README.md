# MTM-Signal

## What is this?

Send and receive messages using the Signal Messenger. This project is a wrapper for <a href="https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli">Signal-CLI</a> giving you a simple OOP API for using signal in a PHP environment.

## Install:

### Requirements:

Linux, PHP 7.x, JRE 11

### Minimal package install on CentOS 7:

```
yum install http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-7.rpm
yum install php74-php-cli --enablerepo=remi
ln -s /usr/bin/php74 /usr/bin/php
yum install java-11-openjdk
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

```

##Quick start:

### Composer install:

```
composer require merlinthemagic/mtm-signal-api
```

### Include Autoloader:

```
require_once "/path/to/mtm-signal/Enable.php";
```

### Get a Client:

```
//Secure the data directory you will be using, private keys and passphrases are stored in plaintext
//make sure the folder is writable by your php user
$safePath		= "/path/to/secure/folder/";

//For testing on linux you can use the following:
//$safePath		= MTM_FS_TEMP_PATH. "sigtest";

$clientObj		= \MTM\SignalApi\Facts::getClients()->getSignalCli();
$clientObj->setDefaultDataDir($safePath);
```

### Get a user to work with:

```
$phoneNumber	= "+12134567890";
$userObj	= $clientObj->getUser($phoneNumber);

```

#### Register New Account via Captcha:

WARNING! This method will disconnect any existing devices from the phone number.
You will be taking over the account, not linking a new device

Goto: https://signalcaptchas.org/registration/generate.html

Complete the Captcha, hit "F12" to open developer tools. Right click the link in the console that starts with: "signalcaptcha://" Copy the link address so you can paste it to the register method below

```
$captcha		= "signalcaptcha://03ADsBq82yYFHDEA.....";
$userObj->registerByCaptcha($captcha); //will throw on error
```

You will receive an SMS code on your device, use that to run the next step of verification

#### Verify New Account via SMS code:

```
$code			= "234568";
$userObj->verifyBySmsCode($code); //will throw on error
```


#### Send a text message from phone number to phone number:

```
$toNbr			= "+13109981100";
$msg			= "Hi Mom,\nPlease buy food, im so hungry!\nThx";
$timeStamp		= $userObj->sendText($toNbr, $msg); //will throw on error
```

#### Receive pending messages for a phone number:

```
//return array of message objects
$array		= $userObj->receive(); //will throw on error
```

#### Link to a master account:

This will generate a URI that can be used to link the client as a slave on an existing master.
This method will NOT disconnect any existing devices. It will simply allow 
a master device to approve the server as a linked account
NOTE: This method is executed on the client object, not on any specific user. The generated user depends on
the master device that accepts the link

```
$name		= "My Test Server"; //shows up on master as identification
$uri		= $clientObj->getDeviceLinkUri($name); //will throw on error
```

Now load the URI into your favorite QR generator or paste it to:
https://www.cssscript.com/demo/pure-javascript-qr-code-generator-qrious/
Then scan the QR code with a master device.
Voila the server has a new linked user account that can send and receive messages

#### Accept slave link request:

This will accept a request to link from a slave.
This method will NOT disconnect any existing devices. It will simply allow 
a slave device to become a linked account of the master account that approves the request
NOTE: This method is executed on the user object. The slave user depends on who generate the uri

```
$uri		= "tsdevice:/?uuid=BBm...";
$userObj->linkDeviceByUri($uri); //will throw on error
```

#### Get Identities:

```
//return array of identity objects
$array			= $userObj->getIdentities(); //will throw on error
```

#### Get Devices:

```
//return array of device objects
$array			= $userObj->getDevices(); //will throw on error
```

#### Get Contacts:

```
//return array of Contact objs
$array			= $userObj->getContacts(); //will throw on error
```
